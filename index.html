    <h2>Exploring Australia's Population Trends</h2>
    <p>
      Australia's population is constantly evolving, with different factors influencing growth in each state. 
      This interactive visualization provides insights into how population changes across Australian states, highlighting the key drivers of growth, 
      including natural population increase (births minus deaths) and net overseas migration.

  <section id="map_story">
    <h3>Population Distribution Across Australian States</h3>
    <p>
        The map below highlights the population change across Australian states. States with higher rates of population growth are shaded darker.
      Use the slider to filter states based on their population size. This provides a geographical overview of population concentration.

  <!-- Storytelling for Bubble Chart -->
  <section id="population_vs_migration_story">
    <h3>Population vs. Net Overseas Migration</h3>
    <p>
      This bubble chart explores the relationship between the population size of each state and the amount of net overseas migration they experience. 
      Larger bubbles represent states with larger populations, and the position of the bubbles indicates their net migration levels. 
      You can filter states by population using the slider or select specific states to highlight their details.

  <!-- Storytelling for Population Factors -->
  <section id="population_factors_story">
    <h3>Population Growth Factors: Births, Deaths, and Migration</h3>
    <p>
      This stacked bar chart breaks down the key factors that contribute to population growth in each state. 
      It shows the number of births, deaths, overseas arrivals, and overseas departures. 
      Understanding these factors helps in assessing how both natural population changes and migration affect the overall population of each state.
